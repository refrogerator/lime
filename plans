- optimize freeTypeVars
- intern all typeclasses
- lists
- adts with generics
- renaming pass at the very start that interns everything
- out of order declaration
- function node with multiple arguments for easier typechecking
- constraint generation -> constraint solving
- figure out which nodes actually need types and which ones don't
- proper name mangling
- closure conversion
- fix parser (comments right after an AssignValue are still parsed as normal code somehow)
- monomorphize `let`s
- let blocks
- out of order definitions
- typeclasses
